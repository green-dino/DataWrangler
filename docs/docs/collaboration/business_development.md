# Exploring Attack Patterns: Enhancing Software Security Beyond Expectations

## Introduction
In business development, ensuring software security is paramount. While Quality Assurance focuses on expected functionality, our security efforts go deeper, examining software in unexpected ways to safeguard resources and data.

## Key Questions for Understanding Technology
To fully grasp a technology or system, consider these critical questions:
- How does the technology function?
- What are the data inputs and outputs?
- When and how does analysis occur?
- What analytical algorithms are used?
- How does it scale?
- How can it be circumvented?
- How do users interact with it?
- What are the user’s responsibilities?
- How does this interaction scale?

## Addressing Malicious Actors
Malicious actors are adept at avoiding detection and focusing on supply-side attacks. This guide will help you counter their efforts, making their tasks more challenging.

## Concrete and Abstract Thinking
- **Concrete**: Think of physical security in houses and cars, with entry points like windows and doors.
- **Abstract**: Apply this to computers, which have ports, protocols, and procedures offering essential services.

## Attack Surface Analysis
Attack Surface Analysis is crucial for:
- Identifying functions and system parts to review/test for vulnerabilities.
- Highlighting high-risk areas requiring defense-in-depth protection.
- Assessing changes in the attack surface for threat evaluation.

## Components of Attack Surface
1. **Paths for Data/Commands**: Entry and exit points for data and commands.
2. **Protection Code for Paths**: Measures safeguarding these paths.
3. **Valuable Data**: Includes secrets, keys, critical business data, personal data, and PII.
4. **Protection Code for Data**: Encompasses encryption, checksums, access auditing, and data integrity.

## Organizing Attack Patterns by Mechanisms
Review attack patterns based on common techniques:
- **Categories**: Deceptive interactions, abuse functionality, manipulate data structures, system resources, inject items, probabilistic techniques, timing and state, information collection, subvert access control.
- **User Types and Attack Points**: Differentiate between unauthenticated users and highly privileged admin users.

## Identifying and Mapping the Attack Surface
1. **Baseline Description**: Create a comprehensive picture by reviewing design and architecture from an attacker’s perspective.
2. **Points of Entry/Exit**: Identify UI forms, HTTP headers, APIs, files, databases, etc.
3. **Managing Attack Points**: Categorize based on function, design, and technology.

## Identifying Weaknesses in Software
- Common vulnerabilities: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows.
- Use CWE to identify trends and inform security policy.

## Benefits of CWEs
CWEs offer several advantages:
Examples: CWEs offer demonstrative examples and sample attack payloads, which serve as practical references for understanding how specific weaknesses can be exploited. These examples help developers and security professionals to recognize similar patterns in their own code and take preventive measures.

Links: CWEs connect to observed examples and related attack patterns through the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC). This linkage provides a comprehensive view of how vulnerabilities are exploited in real-world scenarios, enabling better threat modeling and mitigation strategies.



## Specific Weaknesses to Address
1. **CWE-862**: Missing Authorization.
2. **CWE-918**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
3. **CWE-639**: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key.

## Thinking Like an Attacker
Understand how attackers avoid detection:
- **Fingerprinting OS**: Determine OS for path traversal.
- **Experimentation with Input Parameters**: Observe system responses.
- **Exploiting Vulnerabilities**: Inject path traversal syntax.

## Conclusion
In business development, security testing is an ongoing process. Even with thorough testing, vulnerabilities may remain. Continuous improvement and scrutiny of all security aspects are essential for a secure software environment, ensuring robust protection and fostering trust with stakeholders.
