# Mission

## My Thoughts on Documentation
As a developer, I've learned that documentation is key to making programs easy to understand and use. I focus on what tasks the user needs to accomplish, rather than just explaining the inner workings of my program.

## What I've Learned About Documentation
Adding documentation strings to each function doesn't always tell the reader how to use my program. Strategically placed hints can be incredibly effective.

## How I Approach Documentation
When writing documentation, I put myself in the user's shoes and ask:

* What steps will the user need to take to achieve their goals?
* Where might they get stuck or confused?
* What information would make their job easier?

## Tips I've Found Helpful
* Write for humans, not computers. Explain things clearly and simply.
* Focus on what the code does, not how it works under the hood.
* Use consistent formatting and style throughout the docs.
* Include examples whenever possible to show practical application.
* Keep documentation updated as the code changes. Outdated info is worse than no info at all!

## The Tools I Use
I've found a few tools that help manage documentation:

* **Sphinx** - Great for generating documentation from docstrings, especially for larger projects.
* **JSDoc** - Fantastic for documenting JavaScript projects with built-in support for many common frameworks.
* **Doxygen** - Primarily for C/C++/C#, but also useful for other languages when needed.

## My Goal
My goal is to create documentation that benefits both myself and my team. It should be:

* Clear enough for new users to get started quickly.
* Detailed enough for experience developers to dive deep if needed.
* Flexible enough to evolve as our project grows and changes.
