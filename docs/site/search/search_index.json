For smaller datasets, Pandas is the go-to tool. For larger, distributed data or shared storage, SQLite can efficiently handle tabular data.</p> <pre><code>import pandas as pd\nimport sqlite3\n\n# Load data from SQLite\nconn = sqlite3.connect('data.db')\ndata = pd.read_sql_query(\"SELECT * FROM sales_data\", conn)\n\n# Quick inspection\nprint(data.head())\nprint(data.info())  # Check for missing or inconsistent data\n</code></pre> <p>Step 2: Cleaning Data</p> <p>Messy data often contains missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats. Pandas offers powerful methods to clean this data interactively.</p> <p>Handling Missing Values: <pre><code># Fill missing values with a placeholder or interpolate\ndata['revenue'].fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n# Drop rows with critical missing data\ndata.dropna(subset=['date', 'region'], inplace=True)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Remove Duplicate Rows <pre><code># Remove duplicate rows\ndata.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)\n</code></pre></p> <p>Standarize Formats <pre><code># Ensure consistent date formats\ndata['date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['date'])\n</code></pre></p> <p>Step 3: Scaling Up with Dask</p> <p>When working with datasets too large for memory, Dask extends Pandas-like operations for scalable processing.</p> <pre><code>import dask.dataframe as dd\n\n# Load large dataset with Dask\ndask_data = dd.read_csv('large_sales_data.csv')\n\n# Perform operations (e.g., filling missing values)\ndask_data['revenue'] = dask_data['revenue'].fillna(0)\n\n# Compute results\ncleaned_data = dask_data.compute()\n</code></pre> <p>Step 4: Orchestrating Pipelines with Dagster</p> <p>To manage complex workflows, such as integrating cleaning, transformation, and storage tasks, Dagster provides a robust orchestration layer.</p> <pre><code>from dagster import job, op\n\n@op\ndef load_data():\n    return pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')\n\n@op\ndef clean_data(raw_data):\n    return raw_data.dropna().drop_duplicates()\n\n@op\ndef save_to_sqlite(cleaned_data):\n    conn = sqlite3.connect('cleaned_data.db')\n    cleaned_data.to_sql('sales_data_cleaned', conn, if_exists='replace')\n\n@job\ndef data_cleaning_pipeline():\n    raw_data = load_data()\n    cleaned_data = clean_data(raw_data)\n    save_to_sqlite(cleaned_data)\n</code></pre> <p>Step 5: Storing and Distributing Cleaned Data</p> <p>After cleaning, SQLite provides an excellent lightweight option for storing and sharing relational data.
